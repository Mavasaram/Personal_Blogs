We were in Columbus last weekend, had fun in Ohio State fare '14. It reminded me of our childhood days Durga fare in Madanapalle... Very eventful.

Date: August 9th '14 - Today we went to downtown Dublin Ohio, Ironically its a super moon day, occurs approximately every 13 months. Biggest Moon in year 2014.
