dr r no wrong decisions r rite decisions, just tough decision. take a decision, and try to make it rite (as you 'believe' its rite,), ...! Rest is just the result....if result is good its success, otherwise its circus, either of them its just an experience, believe in ur self, stick to rite things, or make ur belief rite, after-all what your believe says wtz ur character is.. Tomorrow is always awesome and optimistic, but 'today' a wonderful opportunity, opportunity to make yourself better and better and better...
if some thing looks impossible, i say its impossible only, till we make it possible, some one say complex, i understand he is thinking complex, if some one say easy, i know its going to screw... and so decisions.... nothing is easy noting is complex.. its just the way we look at it...
