This week is special in many ways, 

One.
My interest of taking technical sessions, was fulfilled with my workflow training, this week,that was good, good response, nice experience, good learning, it was a 3 day session, 4 hours per day.

Two.
I will be leaving my cubical 049 this week end, my work place is going to get changed, this change is not the end, a beginning. Beginning of new learning.

For the past 2 years, December ‘06 to December ’08, 049 was a speechless witness to my feelings. Successes. Failures. Learning. Disappointments.Finally Departure.

Three.
These days i like to write short posts, simple short posts, expresses my feelings, and this post is a kind of special, m writing it directly in my blog, with out using editors ;).

Friday, tomorrow, last date in current project, moving to new project, Monday, a new Week.
