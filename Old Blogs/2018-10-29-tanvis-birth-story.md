When I saw Tanvi first time, my first thought was like, "Looks like Kovid". Tanvi was born on the perfect score like date in October. In labor room except me, everyone was female, from the moment she was born everyone talking about Tanvi's eyelashes.

 I can't imagine, the pain, anxiety, relieve, love, excitement Nikhila experienced in this 9 months journey, hopefully, she forgets everything looking at someone looks like her.

When we told Kovid we going to the hospital, Kovid was super excited to meet his sister, All day he was excited bit shy, bit nervous, a bit like a big brother, a bit of everything. That was the cutest version of my Kovid I ever saw.

 Kovid gifted a toy to Tanvi, spent all day with his sister. At the end..."I can take her with me"...

Look at his eyes, I never saw them that anxious :) 

First Time: Kovid met Tanvi
