Life is moving fast after May 2nd, do you know why? My wife reached Houston from India, it was like we just got married on May 2nd 2014, instead of May 15th 2013. Had great fun in our first wedding anniversary, followed by stay in Los angles for month.  Now, we are in Ohio, Columbus due to project work.

One Memorable Moment with my wife Niki...

Adventures in Maui Island

I miss you in Facebook, as I stopped using it but will be in touch with you in my blog.

With love..
