Calm sunset...Full moon with chilling air...
long talk about nothing...gentle smile saying everything...
feel of beloved.feel of belief...
wakeup call each day..good nite mail every nite..
ur my wish..ur my luck..ur my dream..
Queen of my thoughts..You are always in my mind..
a star came from sky’s..ur always in front of my eyes..

it’s a vacuum without you..it’s 410 am and you cross one more glorious year...
happy returns of the day honey....
you said  ..."do i need to tell you"....
