Yet again, Diwali, festival of lights, crackers, candles, celebrations and carefulness.

  A day we celebrate behalf of good, to its win over the evil.

I wish my friends, relatives, well wishers and their family members, Happy Diwali.

Now, a word to spread. Its time to fight with evil, again.

Evil - Pollution.

I want to celebrate this Diwali, with colors of light, just with lights, so, no to crackers, no to plastic, no to candles.

Why can’t we try, this time, with lamps made of mud, oil instead candle, distribution of sweets instead of crackers?

Let us make this Diwali a 'festival of change' to save our culture, customs and climate.

I am starting to home tomorrow, 4 days of festival, food, fun, friends and joy.

be a change you want to see in the society
- Mvk.
