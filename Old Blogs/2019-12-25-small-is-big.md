Daily small progress is much more effective, productive & efficient, compared to taking up a gigantic task all at once.

I just got great joy and satisfaction in following this principle once again in my personal life. Going into details...I firmly believe in DIY theory. Recently I purchased an additional storage rack for my garage. After reading the manual, watching online videos, I summarised the DIY process as six steps.

1) Find the correct position on ceiling joist and drill holes for the ceiling brackets

2) Fix ceiling brackets to the roof

3) Assemble Vertical Posts and FixVertical Posts to ceiling brackets

4) Attach outside frames

5) Central frame

6) Finally fixing the wire decks.

Hardest was the first step, finding wooden studs on the garage ceiling joist was the hardest, for my home they are side to side and they are not uniformly distributed. I spent a couple of hours and tried two more times to find correct positions, tempted to call in Amazon Home Services to fix it several times, and then strongly reminded my self about small-and-regular-progress theory. I started to carefully measure lengths, using a stud finder to find ONE position per day and I stoped the work once I find a position. It took 3 days to find a rite spot for the first two horizontal ceiling brackets. It took two more days to find the right position for the next two ceiling brackets, drilling one more day.  Final assembly one more day.

Overall start to finish, it was a week-after-office-work. Small progress made on a daily basis results in a very fulfilling product. 

Here is a Before & After picture for the storage rack.
