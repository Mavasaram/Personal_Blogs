This blog was in 'Draft' mode almost 4 years. Some how missed it to 'Publish'.

Seventeenth, October 2011. It was going to be a great day, I know it, even before I open my eyes on the bed,well awaited day, however there was a beautiful unexpected surprise. 

What I know was... I am going to join my 2nd Company after 5.5 yrs association with Wipro Technologies, not sure what to call my Old company, may be I can call it my SECOND College. I got graduated and joined Wipro on June 26, '06 to earn my first salary & to learn my life lessons. Wonderful journey. In fact, I made a video for that, Click here to see.

What I don't know ...was about this little angel baby girl for my Sister, on the same day. At first instance, she was not looking like her mother (my sister, Deepthi), she looks like my Mother.

For my Lovely Niece Ananyaa.... Click Here to see video about Ananaya.
