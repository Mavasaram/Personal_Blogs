Shifts – it’s a part of life. I could clearly observe that in my path.

Now my working hours had changed to 1430 to 2330. I start it far early and ends it little late may be next day.

My current organization gave me many things – friends, colleagues, good managers, great work, and joy of getting recognized, opportunity to give and take trainings, out standing annual performance ratings. I am happy. But, EOD vitamin M – Money does matter.

Reactive - conditions and situations taking control on you.
Proactive – you take control on your situations by making fair decisions.

I am proactive most of the times, if some one feel I am reactive, I don’t like revisiting it. For my career, I am the right manager, I listen to others to see d better ways to do things. Every one is unique. So no common solutions and situations.

Take decisions, lay your plans, work for results, dream your success, review result, accept failures, and obey work ethics – this might be a character I am desperately trying to achieve.

I should forget about earning, learn first, was my thought last year. Now, Priorities changed.

Should I allow priorities to work on me?? Should be NO. To now I can't share many things about what I am doing, But, I am taking few crucial decisions, turns my carrier.

Excellence is an attitude not a skill.
