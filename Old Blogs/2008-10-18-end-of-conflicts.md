You can take right decisions only if you have experience, you will get experience only when you take wrong decision 
Recently – I took few decisions, which made me more responsible, more confident, stronger and charged up.
Did I succeed with those decisions?? . . . May be no, but, I got experienced.
Things, happened around and after 3rd week of August were great and equally painful.
There was a conflict between my mind and heart. Heart said, ‘Over look the things’, and, the Mind said, ‘if you do so, you are the looser’.
There was a conflict between my earning and learning. That was a conflict between my opportunities and my capabilities.
Capabilities proved, you were up to the IT (information technology) market, and, I got various offers.
Opportunities, yelled, “In future IT need experts, only experts, you be one among them, grab the learning opportunities”.
Finally I won the race, a race with the time, time of 2 months.
In these 2 months, I asked few well wishers to tell me what is correct, and what is wrong.
Finally I asked a guy, a very important guy, interesting guy, he asked me to write down my priorities, opportunities, requirements, and that leads to a decision.
Thanks to that guy, myself.
I respected, my opportunities to improve my capabilities, my heart convinced my mind, and my mind made it self ready for one more mission which was not impossible.
Thanks to all my friends, colleagues, managers, relatives and family for supporting me in this time. Now, I continued to be a 'WIPROITE'
