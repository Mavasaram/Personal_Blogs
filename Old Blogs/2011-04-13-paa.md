Missing your love, guidance, anger, smile, jokes, appreciation, inspiration, maths, warmth hand on my head when I am down every time, missing a lot in life when I look back what happed 8 long yrs ago..
It gives me a great confidence when ever I thought you are with me, still you are alive in my dreams, every act, every work, mistake, win, fear and behavior.
God took away the word 'naana'  from me. Rest in peace Dad...
Mee..Babloo
