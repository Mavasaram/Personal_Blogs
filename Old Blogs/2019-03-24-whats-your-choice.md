How do you make choices? 

How do you finalize your options?

You remember your last miserably failed decision?

How do you re-calibrate your choices to stay on course?

What makes you think you made the right choice based on the situation? 

When you fail, you take responsibility or blame external factors or influences?

On a day from the moment, we wake up from the bed, till we go back to sleep, At an average human will get around 70K thoughts.  Most of them are about making choices and decisions.
 

let's see if we can breakdown our choice making process, with two hypothetical situations,
 

Situation 1: You Found a ten 10$  and 100$ note on a desk, and you are allowed to take only one, which once you choose and why? (Don't read, make your choice & think why?)
 

My simple answer is 100$ note because it got more value & I can buy or invest more with it if I make this choice.
 

Situation 2: You got 100$ note and 4 tickets for your families favorite premium show for the coming weekend? What's your choice?
 

My answer will be premium show tickets, why? that's costly to buy for this weekend, most importantly if I attend that show, I emotionally feel happy and hopefully, my family will be happy too, any journey with family is always memorable.
 

More I think about how I make my choices, decisions, behavior, communications, actions, retrospection's & gratitude is based on how I "value" the outcomes. Simply, based on my values, or value system. Now, we got a new question (remember, our original question is "What's your choice?") What are your deeply rooted core values? What's are the benefits "value" based decisions system? (We will discuss more in my next blog post)

Let's see how one can define your value system. It's simple(!), just revisit some of your best & worst decision, what instincts made you move that direction? oh, wait, if that doesn't look simple at all, with a daily rate of 70k thoughts per day, If you can't look back! Okay, let's look forward, let's see if we can think about every choice you make now on wards and re-think end of the day or week to retrospect why you made that choice & prepare your core values.

Think about what are your core values? At the end of the day, week, month, a year or even on last day of your life, what do you cherish the most, must be your top value right? 

Will continue to ponder my thoughts about core values based decisions & will share a glimpse of my own values, I worked on it over the last several months, all in my next blog.

 

Warm regards,
