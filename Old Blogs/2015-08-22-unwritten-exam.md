Continued reading question paper after 45 minutes into 10th class Telugu exam, Bujji didn't understand a lot of questions, instead got additional questions...

1.   Does the examiner want to kill Telugu?

2.  Can my newly purchased examination pen or pad turn my fortune?

3.  Are there any simple ways to play-shuttle-before-exam and get marks?

4.  Poems’? Grammar ... telegraph morse code sound continued..

5.  OMG.. this looks like a physics question...but, why is it in Telugu paper?

6.  What the hell other guys are writing..

7.   Look at that Shakeel..WTH is he up to & writing 

8.  Let me take an "Additional" will that makes me Hero with zero marks..

9.  What if "I write anything" and I get 90%

10. All the questions look very generic; should I generalize the answer too..

Questions still flowing... Bujji, sweating, and shivering feel the earth moving under his feet,  air electrified around him; the exam invigilator looks like an interrogation officer, holding his head with his hands.. thinking about his father's reaction to failure in the exam and many more. Closed eyes in pain of failure in Telugu exam!

 

Suddenly Opened the eyes to the bed, mid-night from a deep dream, in Raleigh North Carolina US.

 

PS: The reality was, that Bujji painfully completed that exam with 74 marks and continued playing games for the rest of the exams, and got the least percentage expected out of him in the 10th class. But that first exam fears never left him and revisits him as exam nightmares. That's the end of the unwritten exam by Bujji many years after writing the exam with no preparation
