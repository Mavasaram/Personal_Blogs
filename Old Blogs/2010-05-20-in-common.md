A.R.Rahman, Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar , SPB, Shane Warne, Michael schumacher, Vishy so on.. this list has unlimited limits, unlimited limitations, limited impossible and unlimited overwhelming joy in doing everything they do.

What is in common...?

Their basics are strong, even then - not less than 100000 time they might practiced, they might have dreamt it, while walking while eating while sleeping they can see only one thing, they can think only one thing, their passion, every vicotry made them responsible, every defeat made they stronger, every step made them wiser...

Still something in common...

What might be Vishys thoughts just before the day he played the 12th and final game in world championship, when the scores were tie on 11th game.

What i can guess is, what it can't be – he must hv not thought this... “Day-after tomorrow will I woke up as a champion or a looser?”  Because A day later he is the CHAMPION.

So, let us listen what is in common from a champion..

Champions aren't made in the gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them -- a desire, a dream, a vision - Muhammad Ali

I am preparing for an exam after almost 4 year, all these 4 year reading became my habit, after 4 years still it can't be a habit, now its my character! Now all i need is good practice..

donno whether i will be a champ or looser ... but i know i am enjoying this exam preparation... i love journey, rather the destination.

with love,

Vamsi
