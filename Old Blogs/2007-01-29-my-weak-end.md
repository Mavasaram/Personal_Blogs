Its true that time will have expansion and contraction. May be this way: The 9 hours that I have spent in my college couple of days back passed away just like few minutes. And probably I will never forget those moments in my life.
Cheers to all the 22 people who made their presence; proud to say we crossed another mile stone called MITR-07 (MITS Reunion-07). We are the pioneers for all student centered associations like ILLUMINATUS, POSITRON, and 6th Element. Hope every thing started from our batch will continue. Those who missed this chance of attending Alumni meet - don’t worry; you just plan another interesting event in our department, we swear our participation and presence.
The best part of the whole event was juniors made some stalls with smileys ( :), :( …) and the gained profit goes to SR (Sarvepalli Radha Krishna) trust, started for welfare of poor children. They sold Indian flags in the eve of republic day, again profits go to SR trust. That’s really a great initiative and an equally good implementation. I felt so proud and guilty because they are doing a work which we never thought. That’s the spirit of education; we have to think beyond horizons. Apart from curriculum subjects there are many things (responsibilities). Congrats to my juniors, I always heartily welcome them for my help.
Thanks to Sunil for organizing such a great event. Really it’s my pleasure to work with you, hope I learnt a lot with your interactions.
