Ananyaa looks exactly like my sister Deepthi,
when she was kids. If you have sister, you can recollect, how many times you fought with her, but still, Sister is always first
friend. Happy birthday to my little Angel, god
bless you Ananyaa.

Ananyaa with Ammama on her second birthday.

Few moments in life just passes when you really don't worry about them. Like, My current Job in IBM, just completed two years.
