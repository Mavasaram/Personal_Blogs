Bujji went to the
teacher and asked…

“What is Love?”
Teacher will never find it in the academic syllabus about this topic in
India, and, such topic is not for discussion at any age. But
every one does.

She thought for few
Seconds, it was like a hour for her.

Teacher brought him out
of class, “Go get the largest Corn in that field”, teacher pointed to the
fields next to the school.

“But you should go
through them only Once, you can’t turn back to pick”

He understood, went to
the field, and felt the corn in the first row was big enough to pick, but
decided to move on to second, “May be there is a bigger one later”.

Another big one in
next row, but “May be there is a bigger one”, He reached half point, and
feeling that the earlier one was much bigger than the current corns, regretted.
Ended up, went to the teacher with empty hands.

Teacher said, “That is
Love”.

Next Morning, Student
again went to teacher and asked, “What is Marriage?”…

“Go get the Biggest
Corn in the field, same rule as before!”

Went to the field,
started searching for the bigger corn, just before reaching middle of field, he
found one corn, which he 'felt' that big enough and satisfied.

 “Good, you found this time, You look for one
that is just nice, and you have faith and believe this is the best one you
get, This is marriage.

Happy reading,

Vamsi
