Yes. Scattering of team. A Tea team. A Wednesday PVR night show team. A "love to laugh" team. An all andhra lunch team.

Venu will be starting to 'US of A' next week. I wish you all success in your new role Venu.

Soon, Pavan will be Joining Venu. Later, Jaggu will also become 'The American'.

IT provide again, lufthansa flights are always ready for any true talent - good luck Venkat.

In his new tech lead position, busily, steadily adjusting - Subba.

And, I .... will be missing you all!!

World is small enough. Our roads will cross again. May be at Wednesday PVR night show ;-).

Let me show you. Left to Right. One after the other. 

Konduri Venkat Phani prasad. In short Venkat.
Venkata Jagadish pothuri. Jaggu- 'cool'est of all and equally hardworking.
Mohan Vamsi Krishna Avasaram - single person. MVK.
Valluru Subba reddy. Subba.
Venugopal Reddy Edulakanti. Dear QA. Venu.
Pavankumar vasudev Hukkeri. My ABAP reference point.
