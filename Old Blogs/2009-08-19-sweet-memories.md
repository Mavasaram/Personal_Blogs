Really not sure when we took this picture, ltz perform radio isotope dating little later to find picture date, but this was my first ever picture in my first ever school (New Little Flower High School), its precious and very very special. After my 3rd Class, I was shifted to Other (my dad working) school... (updated this picture on 30th April 2011)

7 years later...

My 10th Class Picture, farewell party, we are Millennium batch (Yr 2000 pass outs). Do you now, chief guest for this party was my Dad, worked as Math's teach for long years in the same school, 6th Person in 4th row.. I can re-collect his full speech on that day..!

After Six beautiful years..

We completed our B.Tech some where in May 2006, this is our farewell party day in our MITS college Madanapalle. Beautiful day.

Many more next time.
