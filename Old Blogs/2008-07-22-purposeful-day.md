That was a noble cause, and a selfless effort. Contributors, Participants, donors, deserved beneficiaries, college staff, juniors all together, every one, made The Elixir a great success.

This weekend, I was at college, attending Elixir - scholarship program. The actual brain behind this program was Sunil. 

Sunil, I spoke to this fellow in my 3rd year of engineering. Every step in his career n college took me by surprise. Illuminatus, Sixth element, Positron, MITR, Elixir were all big events originated from his small thoughts. Working with him has always been a pleasure. You are a born leader dude a born leader.

Hari Krishna had put all his efforts to select 3 deserved candidates from 3 batches. However  in last moment, after holding a discussion with individuals, we made it 4 candidates from 3 years. Two of them to share one scholarship.

And, we had a good support from college staff and Juniors. The scholarships distributed along with our favorite Illuminatus session and prize distribution for Ecom Function were held between 2pm and 4.30pm. And, The Day was purposeful.
