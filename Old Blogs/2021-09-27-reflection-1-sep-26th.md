Everything works when reset. This certainly applies to human & human relations as well. Managing kids' schedules, managing family, Office schedules & expectations, managing external stress, all add up; it takes a bigger toll on you, your life, and your loved ones. We must take some time off & do something different, unless you break the routine schedule, you don’t feel like living. Everyone needs some time & space for solitude. This weekend is one of best to count in, in that aspect.

Kids don’t listen to us; they repeat actions. Regardless of the situation, if you can’t behave well, you can’t expect kids to behave well either. I could see Kovid & Tanvi shouting at each other occasionally, maybe it’s because of what we are doing without consciousness. Time for simple changes when I am talking: think before I talk, express dissatisfaction without anger/shouting. That rolls up the most impact and finally reflects this weekend. 

Communication. The proverb "Talk is cheap, but action speaks" is true. However, talk is not always cheap; it is the most impactful and easy mechanism to build trust and relation. Choose your words carefully, think as if someone were saying the same thing. Choose an impactful conversation vs talking more. Connect with your loved ones regularly.
