Following poem, this was taught by my English teacher with a special interest to the class. This is a small thought in Tagore mind more than 100 years ago,but it reflect the present barriers and hurdles in our INDIAN society. Don't Just read this.

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high,
Where knowledge is free,
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow
domestic walls,
Where words come out from the depth of truth,
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection,
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the
dreary desert sand of dead habit,
Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and
Action into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
-- Rabindranath Tagore. Just before we celebrate our INDE60 - We need to look back where we are? And, we are where we are 100 years ago and this thought provoking poem is a speech less evidence.

This post is not to point out where we are going wrong, but to recollect where we are. Happy reading. Salutes to all national leaders who fought for our national freedom. Happy reading.
