Horror in all Indian cities  Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Surat, Chennai, and Hyderabad all were on their toes since last week, 25th Jul 08, to protect itself. But, from whom??

In Bangalore, two people died in blasts, Peace was killed, fear conquered, panic occupied every heart, roomers running around, all together, that was a day, a day of blood, where innocent people were aimed and killed.Two innocent people,their family can’t see them again. Never ever again.

Ahmedabad, it’s the pinnacle violence, 53 people killed, no MURDERED!

May god rest their soul in peace and give courage to their families to withstand this punishment for the mistake which they never did!!

What I did that day...
- I was shocked to listen about the blasts.
- Searched all Bangalore contacts in my mobile and conveyed my safe.and Inquired d same.
- I was watching CNN IBN. Thinking about innocent deaths.Murders.

How unsecured life is???
