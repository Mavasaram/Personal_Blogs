thanks to all my dearest and lovely friends, colleagues and parents for your warm wishes for my 25th birthday..

- this time i wrote personal emails thanking all my friends who sent me wishes online... in that mail i added my special memories with them.. dt was lovely... Mr.CSC din't like dt..

- this time i got my first birthday bumps ... omg... my back became numb for an hour... finally i added "guys thanks for giving me my 1st b'day bumps" ... they got excited and pulled my legs and hands wider to give me more bumps .. :-(... so never say thanks for things which hurts you physically...inspite touches your heart :-)

- one of my dearest friend sent me this...reads good ahaa..

- 2day the same day my mom also born (as mother) :-) .. happy mother day maa..

with love..
vam'C'
